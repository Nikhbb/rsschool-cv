I am a beginner Frontend Developer currently studying at [RS School](https://rs.school/courses "Про школу). I have no professional development experience yet, but I am a goal-oriented and motivated person who learns quickly and always finishes what I start. At the moment, I am actively studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on practical tasks and creating small training projects.

My goal is to become a sought-after Frontend Developer, capable of building user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing web applications. I strive to grow in the IT field, learn modern frameworks, write clean and maintainable code, and work effectively within a team.
